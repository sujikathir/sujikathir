I'm passionate about __Machine Learning__, __Data Science__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__. 

I love exploring how AI can solve real-world problems and create new possibilities. Always excited to learn and share cool projects!

<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>
I hold a Masters Degree in Business Analytics with a specialisation in Data Science from UT Dallas.
I have 3+ years of experience building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models.

Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

üî≠ Some of the notable courses I have completed and that helped in gaining strong theoretical foundation include: 
* *Machine Learning Certification by [__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/)*
* *Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/)*
* *Data Science Professional Certificate by [__IBM__](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)*
* *Python for Everybody Specialization by [__University of Michigan__](https://online.umich.edu/series/python-for-everybody/)*

üî≠ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* *Linear Regression*
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*
* *Random Forests (RF)*
* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
* *Deep Neural Networks*
* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects: 

* *Auto-Regressive (AR) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model*
* *Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model*
* *Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model*
* *The Prophet Forecasting Model by Facebook*

üî≠ Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for __Generative AI__:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *Llama Index*
* *OpenAI API*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *Llama 2 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3.5 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 4 (LLM)*
